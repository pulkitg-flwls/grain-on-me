# Denoising Shots Dataset Evaluation

We select 4 movies and divide them into easy and hard based on the amount of denoising required.

Some observations:
+ `ufof1` has lot of shots where the actors are always moving or many actors are clustered together
+ `smug01` has many shots where the actors are occluded when they are in focus. There are some interview shots with some significant action happening in the background. 
+ `vmdf02` has lot of noisy shots including color noise present in many frames.
+ `book01` also has significant amount of occlusions.
